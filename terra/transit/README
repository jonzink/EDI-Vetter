These routines are based on the work in Mandel & Agol (2002),
so please cite this paper if you make use of these routines
in your research.

For extremely accurate lightcurves, we recommend the non-linear
routine.  For very fast lightcurves, we recommend the
small-planet routine.  For accurate lightcurves with reasonable
speed, we recommend the quadratic limb-darkening routines.

For a quick start, we recommend going into IDL and running
the routine compcoeff.pro: just type "@compcoeff" at the
command line.  To see how the IDL routines are called, simply
look at the text of compcoeff.pro.  To see how the fortran
routines are called, run "@compfortidl."

1)  Non-linear limb-darkening:

    a)  testnl.f   - fortran 77 program which calls occultnl.f
    b)  occultnl.f - fortran 77 subroutine for computing
        eclipses for non-linear limb-darkening
    c)  compfortidl.pro - compares fortran and IDL routines
        simply start IDL and type "@compfortidl.pro."  This
        routine compiles the fortran routines, runs them,
        and compares the speed with the IDL routine
    d)  occultnl.pro - IDL routine which computes lightcurve
        of non-linear limb-darkened source

2)  Quadratic limb-darkening:

    a)  test.f - fortran 77 program which calls the subroutine 
        occultquad
    b)  occultquad.f - fortran 77 subroutine which computes
        lightcurves for quadratic limb-darkened sources
    c)  occultquad.pro - IDL routine

3)  Small-planet approximation:

    a)  occultsmall.pro - computes lightcurve for a small planet
    b)  occultsmall.f   - fortran program & subroutine for
        computing the lightcurve of a small planet
    c)  compcoeff.pro   - creates figure 2 from Mandel & Agol
        by calling occultsmall.pro and occultnl.pro

4)  Limb-darkening coefficients:

    a)  transit.pro - IDL routine which finds quadratic limb-darkening 
        coefficients from Claret (2000) grid (in quadratic.dat)
    b)  transitnl.pro - IDL routine which finds nonlinear limb-darkening
        coefficients from Claret (2000) grid in atlas.dat

5)  Other routines:

    a)  rf.for, rd.for, rc.for - fortran routines from Numerical Recipes
    b)  ellec.f, ellk.f, ellec.pro, ellk.pro - approximations to the 
        complete elliptic integrals from Abramowitz & Stegun (1965)
    c)  rf.pro, rd.pro, rc.pro - IDL routines modified from the
        Numerical Recipes routines
